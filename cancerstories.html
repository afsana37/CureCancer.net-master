<h2>Corey Wood, 23, A recent graduate</h2>
<img src="corey.jpg" alt="corie wood" style="float:center;width:300px;height:202px" align="right">

<p> A week after she graduated from Berkeley, Corey found out she had lung cancer. She had never smoked had run several marathons with zero symptoms. Then she started noticing a small flashing in her right eye, which she mentioned to her doctor during an eye exam. Eventually, a scan showed tumors in her left lung, spine, hip bone, and a tiny one behind her eye (that’s what had been causing the flashing). Fortunately, she has able to take advantage of targeted therapies. She takes a pill and hasn’t needed chemo, and her recent scans are clear.</p>
 What she’s done: Corey took on white water kayaking in summer 2014 as part of Epic Experience, and she now volunteers with the group and leads expeditions. She’s also an active member of the LUNG FORCE initiative</p>


<p> How it has helped: “Although I was initially apprehensive about rafting because I had tried it and didn’t like it, I’m more adventurous now. You go out each day, probably are in the water once every day for a few hours, in class 1-3 rapids. You get very nervous because you do flip your kayak–you’re upside down, strapped in–but it ends up being ok. With the adrenaline, you have to focus on getting through that rapid rather than cancer or what’s waiting for you at home. It requires you to be very in the moment.”</p>

<h2>Amberly Wagner-Connolly, age 34, student</h2>
<img src="amberly.jpg" alt="amberly" style="float:center;width:300px;height:202px" align="right">
<p>Amberly was diagnosed with breast cancer at 28, a few months after giving birth to twins. At that time, she was also raising a four-year-old and working as a nurse while studying for her master’s degree. Despite a double mastectomy and a year of treatment, she was still able to finish graduate school and land a faculty position teaching public health to nurses (she was bald at the time of her job interview).</p>

<p>What she’s done: Amberly is focusing on her lifelong dream to bring respite to parents who have been diagnosed with cancer. She’s a volunteer for a national organization called Camp Kesem (free camp for kids whose parents have cancer), and she serves on the local advisory board and the national parent committee. She’s pursuing her doctorate in nursing with a focus on global health (graduation is in sight!), and hopes to one day run a respite house that provides relief and services for parents with cancer and their children.</p>

<p>What it meant to her: “Going through cancer while raising young kids, I realized there’s a huge lack of resources for this very special population. I now have six kids, with another on the way (our family includes three post-cancer babies and I even adopted my niece this year). It’s a crazy life I live, but having cancer as a young mom opened so many doors for me and made me brave enough to go after my dreams.”</p>

<h2>Six-year-old’s inspiring story of battling and beating cancer</h2>

<img src="brave.jpg" alt="child cancer" style="float:center;width:400px;height:150px" align="right">
<p>Maeve Low is a brave six-year-old child cancer survivor, who beat this deadly disease with the help of her Singaporean parents.She was diagnosed with stage 2 Burkitt’s Lymphoma, which is an aggressive cancer that attacks the digestive system.</p>

<p>In the next several months, Maeve had to get intense chemotherapy amounting to four and a half rounds of treatment. Her family watched and helped her day and night — hoping and praying that this bad dream would go away. After four long months of battling, Maeve was finally deemed cancer-free!</p>
<p>To honour her daughter’s fight against cancer, Maeve’s mother, Joanne Poon wrote an illustrated story about her daughter’s battle to inspire and motivate her to actively fight against the disease. This story was turned into a book called Brave Maeve, which was published and translated into seven languages and shipped to children’s cancer foundations in over 14 countries.</p>
